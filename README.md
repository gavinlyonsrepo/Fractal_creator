* Name: fractal_creator

* Description: 
Fractal Creator. This Demo program is written in C++. 
This project creates a bitmap file (800x600) and 
then applies two magnification functions 
to a sector of that file. The bitmap is a graphic image.
The graphic image is a fractal created by the Mandelbrot Set.
A fractal in mathematics is an abstract object used to describe 
and simulate naturally occurring objects. Fractals can also be nearly the 
same at different levels.
